And a written explanation of your solution

//Use two pointers:
function consecutiveSubstrings(inputString):
    resultList ← empty list
    stringLength ← length of inputString

    FOR startIndex FROM 0 TO stringLength - 1:
        FOR endIndex FROM startIndex + 1 TO stringLength:
            substring ← slice of inputString from startIndex to endIndex (exclusive)
            ADD substring TO resultList

    RETURN resultList

#Explanation:
1.Use two pointers: start index of the substring, and end index, starting just after the start index.
2.Loop though the string:
	•	Outer loop: picks the start index of the substring.
	•	Inner loop: picks the end index, starting just after the start index.
3. The slice is taken from startIndex to endIndex (exclusive), so all substrings are consecutive.
4. Append the Substrings into resultList in the order they appear.
